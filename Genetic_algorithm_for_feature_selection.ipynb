        "_________\n",
        "#### The Genetic Algorithm(GA) is an evolutionary algorithm(EA) inspired by Charles Darwin’s theory of natural selection which espouses Survival of the fittest. As per the natural selection theory, the fittest individuals are selected to produce offsprings. The fittest parents' characteristics are then passed on to their offsprings using cross-over and mutation to ensure better chances of survival. Genetic algorithms are randomized search algorithms that generate high-quality optimization solutions by imitating the biologically inspired natural selection process such as selection, cross-over, and mutation.\n",

        "![](https://miro.medium.com/max/695/1*vIrsxg12DSltpdWoO561yA.png)\n",
        "#### **Population** contains a set of possible solutions for the stochastic search process to begin. GA will iterate over multiple generations till it finds an acceptable and optimized solution. First-generation is randomly generated.\n",
        "#### **Chromosome** represents one candidate solution present in the generation or population. A chromosome is also referred to as a Genotype. A chromosome is composed of Genes that contain the value for the optimal variables.\n",
        "#### **Phenotype** is the decoded parameter list for the genotype that is processed by the Genetic Algorithm. Mapping is applied to the genotype to convert to a phenotype.\n",
        "#### The **Fitness function** or the objective function evaluates the individual solution or phenotypes for every generation to identify the fittest members.\n",
        "__________\n",
        "### Different Genetic Operators\n",
        "#### **Selection** is the process of selecting the fittest solution from a population, and then the fittest solutions act as parents of the next generation of solutions. This allows the next generation to inherit the strong features naturally. Selection can be performed using Roulette Wheel Selection or **Ranked Selection** based on the fitness value.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Cross-over** or recombination happens when genes from the two fittest parents are randomly exchanged to form a new genotype or solution. Cross over can be a One-point cross over or Multi-Point Cross over based on the parent's segments of genes exchanged.\n",
        "![image.png](attachment:e240e0f3-60da-44b4-81f7-16bb1e506ff5.png)\n",
        "#### Here **One-point Cross-over** is used.\n",
        "#### After a new population is created through selection and crossover, it is randomly modified through **mutation**. A **mutation** is a process to modify a genotype using a random process to promote diversity in the population to find better and optimized solutions.\n",

        "#### 2. A Genetic Algorithm can also be used to determine the best amount of features to include in a machine learning model for predicting the target variable.\n",
